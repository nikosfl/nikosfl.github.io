Sophisticated techhniques for acoustic and language modeling have resulted in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems which can even beat human performance under clean conditions, with the speech signal typically represented by the Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs). However, when the speech signal is distorted by background noise or reverberation there is ususally a severe performance drop. Such distortions are unavoidable when the recording microphone is moved away from the speaker's mouth; thus a challenge of finding more robust representations of the signal arises.
