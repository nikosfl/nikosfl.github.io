<h2 style="text-align:left;"> Who I am </h2>
I am a 3rd year PhD student, member of the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu) at the University of Southern California, advised by [Professor Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.php). My main research interests include Speaker Diarization and Role Recognition, Speech Processing, and Machine Learning. Prior to joining USC, I received my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, where I completed my thesis under the advisement of [Professor Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/index.shtm).

I was born and raised in Athens, the capital city of Greece. My official given name is Nikolaos, one the most common names in Greece, but according to recent surveys [citation needed], no Greek ever called another Greek "Nikolaos".

You can find my CV [here](/assets/NF_cv2.pdf) and my one-page resume [here](assets/NF_resume.pdf).  

Over the last few years, I 've been lucky enough to collaborate with some amazing people working on cool projects, on which you can find some information in my [Research](research) page.

I like to spend my free time either hiking a trail or biking my bike. Whenever I have some more time - or just whenever my travel bug kicks in - I pack a few clothes and go discover a new city, country, or continent.
