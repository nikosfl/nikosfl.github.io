<!-- ## Who I am -->
I am a machine learning researcher working at Apple on acoustic modeling for [automatic speech recognition](https://nikosfl.github.io/research/asr_adaptation).

I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California, where I was working at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu), supervised by [Professor Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.php). Among other projects, as a graduate student I worked extensively on [speaker role recognition](https://nikosfl.github.io/research/srr) and on [behavioral coding](https://nikosfl.github.io/research/behavioral_coding) for psychoterapy. 
Prior to joining USC, I obtained my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, where I completed my thesis under the supervision of [Professor Petros Maragos](http://cvsp.cs.ntua.gr/maragos/index.shtm). 

<!-- You can find some information on the projects I worked on as a student in my [Research & Projects](research) page or by reading some of my [publications](publications). -->

<!-- My main research interests include Speech Processing and Recognition, Speaker Diarization and Identification, and Machine Learning in social computing and healthcare. -->

<!-- I was born and raised in Athens, Greece. My official given name is Nikolaos, one the most common greek names, but according to recent surveys [citation needed], no Greek ever called another Greek "Nikolaos". -->

<!-- ## What I am doing (and have done) -->
<!-- You can find my CV [here](/resume/NF_cv.pdf) and my one-page resume [here](assets/NF_resume.pdf). -->  

I like to spend my free time either hiking a trail or riding my bike. Whenever I have some more time---or just whenever my travel bug kicks in---I pack a few clothes and go [discover a new city, country, or continent](travel). 
<!-- I like to spend my free time hiking a trail, riding my bike, or... jumping out of planes. -->
