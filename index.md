# Who I am
I am a 3rd year PhD student, member of the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory at the University of Southern California, advised by Professor Shrikanth Narayanan. My main research interests include Speaker Diarization and Role Recognition, Speech Processing and Machine Learning. Prior to joining USC, I did my undergrad at the National Technical University of Athens, where I completed my Diploma thesis under the advisement of Professor Petros Maragos.

I was born and raised in Athens, the capital city of Greece. My official given name is Nikolaos, one the most common names in Greece, but according to recent surveys [citation needed], no Greek ever called another Greek as Nikolaos.
