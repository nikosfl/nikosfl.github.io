### Speaker Role Recognition
Speaker Role Recognition is the task of assigning a specific role in a speaker-homogeneous segment, where a role is characterized by the task a speaker performs. Broadcast news programs, call centers, therapy sessions, or interviews are some examples of conversational scenarios where each participant performs some well-defined task and thus plays some role. The approaches that tackle this task depend on successful pre-processing steps applied on the conversation, such as speaker diarization or ASR. However, in real-world settings, this leads to error propagation. Additionally, knowledge of the roles can be proved useful for those pre-processing steps, as well. For example, the language used by an interviewer is expected to be different than the one used by the interviewee, and this is something which can be ideally exploited by a role-aware ASR system by using role-specific language models. 

### Automating Behavioral Coding in Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy intervention studies collect audio and/or videotapes of therapy sessions to use in treatment adherence and process research. These tapes record the complex series of interactions between therapist and client, and as such, they encode the active ingredients of the therapy â€“ when the therapy works, the tapes should tell us why.
